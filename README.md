# Lullaby generation in Spanish
Notebooks used by Menara, Gonimix y Andino team in the AI Song Contest 2021 to generate lullabies in Spanish.

First, we fine-tuned a GPT-2 small Spanish model with a relatively small dataset of lullabies.

After that, we used this notebook to generate the lullabies. This way, the model can be used as a 'blackbox' by people who are not used to read/manipulate code.
